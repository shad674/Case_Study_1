         <h1>About</h1>
        <p> A project which can showcase my projects in a visual and elegant way.  A personal website that has all my information which makes it easier for recruiters or people who want to contact me.

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>Projects and skills are what recruiters and hiring managers often look for in a candidate.  Skills are built by doing projects, and by the time we are proficient in other skills, we often forget to remember all the projects we did over the months that we've been developing to showcase our skills.</p>

          <h1>Challenges</h1>
          <p>the biggest challenge is coding in 3 different web technologies; HTML, CSS and Javascript. Coming in as a Structural Engineering, I did not have any experience in coding websites, I only took introduction programming courses at UCSD such as CSE 8A and CSE 11. I did not have any experience in web development. </p>

          <h1>My role</h1>
          <p>I designed and developed the website. I carefully designed and coded it from scratch. I used web technologies such as HTMl, CSS and Javascript.</p>

         <div>
          <h1>Design Process</h1>
          <p>I searched for good design portfolios on the web and got some inspiration from well recognized front end developers. From there, I sketched some design ideas and tried different formats. I used different colors and fonts to determine the perfect design to match my style.</p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>Not only was I able to show my website to recruiters and hiring  managers, I was also able to show it to my friends. Recruiters and hiring managers have commented on my website, and this led me to say that my personal website did get notice. In the end, my problem of getting interviews and internships was solved, I was able to get 4 software engineering offers, and a big part of my success is my personal website.
